#### Rules of Hooks

1.  Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
    Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2.  Only Call Hooks from React Functions
3.  Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
    ✅ Call Hooks from React function components.
    ✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks .
